Crowd source file extensions

`urls.txt` contains all "No Images Produced" links.

Each url ends in `.pdf` but has another file associated with it like `.mp4 .mp3 .m4v .m4a .xls`.

1. Find a link in `urls.txt` that still has a `.pdf` extension
2. Try different extensions like `.mp4 .mp3 .m4v .m4a .xls`
3. If you find the correct file, update that url in `urls.txt`
